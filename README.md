# Luxai-s2-Baseline
Welcome to the **Lux AI Challenge Season 2**! This repository serves as a baseline for the Lux AI Challenge Season 2, designed to provide participants with a strong starting point for the competition. Our goal is to provide you with a clear, understandable, and modifiable codebase so you can quickly start developing your own AI strategies.

This baseline includes an implementation of the **PPO** reinforcement learning algorithm, which you can use to train your own agent from scratch. The codebase is designed to be easy to modify, allowing you to experiment with different strategies, reward functions, and other parameters.

In addition to the main training script, we also provide additional tools and resources, including scripts for evaluating your AI strategy, as well as useful debugging and visualization tools. We hope these tools and resources will help you develop and improve your AI strategy more effectively.

More information about the Lux AI Challenge can be found on the competition page: [https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-season-2](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lux-ai-season-2-neurips-stage-2)

We look forward to seeing how your AI strategy performs in the competition!
